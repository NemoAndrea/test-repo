title: SpotiStation
description: Spotify-enabled music player built around a raspberry pi and rgb matrix
display. Streams and controls playback as an independent device and uses RGB
matrix display as interface.
intended-use: The design is focussed on being accessible to people with physical and
  cognitive disabilities by use of few and large buttons and simple UI. It
  should allow anyone to enjoy music without supervision.

development-stage: released
development-plans: The project has had an initial release, with some ‘field testing’ to boot.
  The hardware and software are functional, if a little rough around some of the edges. 
  Certainly areas to improve on, but none that require immediate attention. All the design
  files and code are available for reproduction - provided you have basic (electronics) tinkering
  skills.
