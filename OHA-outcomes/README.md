folders in this directory should be named `YYYY` (e.g. `2022`). Deviations from the format will result in problems.

Items **in** the `YYYY` directories with a `.txt` extension will be attempted to be rendered on the website. If you want to add some kind of comments or write other notes for documentation purposes, you could add a markdown file (or any other file with a non-txt extension.)
